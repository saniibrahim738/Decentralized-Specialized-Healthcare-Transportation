# Decentralized Specialized Healthcare Transportation

A blockchain-based platform for coordinating specialized healthcare transportation services securely and efficiently.

## Overview

This decentralized application (dApp) leverages blockchain technology to streamline the coordination of specialized healthcare transportation, particularly for patients with complex medical needs. By decentralizing the management of patient information, driver credentials, trip coordination, and medical equipment tracking, the system creates a more reliable, transparent, and accessible transportation network.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Patient Registration Contract

Securely stores patient transportation needs and medical requirements, allowing for:

- Patient onboarding with medical condition verification
- Special needs documentation (mobility requirements, equipment needs)
- Consent management for data sharing
- Emergency contact information
- Accommodation requirements
- Historical trip data

### Driver Verification Contract

Validates and maintains credentials for healthcare transportation providers:

- Professional qualification verification (medical training, special licenses)
- Vehicle certification records
- Background check confirmation
- Specialized training verifications
- Performance metrics and ratings
- Insurance and liability documentation

### Trip Coordination Contract

Manages the logistics of arranging and tracking medical transportation:

- Appointment scheduling and confirmation
- Route optimization for medical facilities
- Driver-patient matching based on needs and qualifications
- Real-time trip status updates
- Delay notifications
- No-show handling
- Trip completion verification

### Medical Equipment Contract

Tracks specialized equipment availability and certification:

- Equipment inventory management
- Maintenance records and certifications
- Equipment-vehicle assignment
- Cleaning/sterilization tracking
- Equipment requirement matching for patient needs
- Malfunction reporting

## System Architecture

The system operates on a permissioned blockchain network, with different stakeholders having varying levels of access:

- **Patients/Caregivers**: Access to personal records, trip requests, and status updates
- **Drivers/Transport Providers**: Access to assigned trips, patient requirements, and equipment needs
- **Healthcare Providers**: Ability to verify medical requirements and schedule transportation
- **Administrators**: System oversight and dispute resolution capabilities

All data is encrypted and access is granted through secure authentication mechanisms.

## Technical Implementation

- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum/Polygon for smart contract deployment
- **Storage**: IPFS for decentralized storage of larger data files with encrypted patient information
- **Frontend**: React-based web application and mobile app for all stakeholders
- **Integration**: API connections to existing healthcare systems (EHR/EMR) where applicable
- **Oracle Services**: For verification of real-world credentials and certifications

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Patient information stored securely with granular permission controls
- **Increased Reliability**: Transparent verification of driver qualifications and equipment readiness
- **Improved Efficiency**: Automated matching of patient needs with appropriate resources
- **Better Accountability**: Immutable record of all transportation activities
- **Reduced Administrative Burden**: Automated verification and coordination processes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Truffle Suite
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- IPFS node (optional for development)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/healthcare-transport-dapp.git

```

## Usage Examples

### For Patients

1. Register on the platform with verified medical information
2. Request transportation with specific requirements
3. Receive confirmation and driver details
4. Track transportation status in real-time
5. Confirm safe arrival and rate service

### For Drivers

1. Complete verification process with required credentials
2. Receive trip assignments matching qualifications
3. Access necessary patient information and requirements
4. Document equipment used and trip details
5. Complete electronic confirmation of service delivery

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core smart contract development and testing
- **Phase 2**: Frontend application development and integration
- **Phase 3**: Pilot program with selected healthcare providers
- **Phase 4**: Integration with existing healthcare transportation systems
- **Phase 5**: Expanded features including payment processing and insurance verification
